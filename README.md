### What I learned
### What I learned

This project provided a unique experience, particularly in the way I approached layout and styling. I tried SASS for the first time, and it's been a game-changer for organizing my styles. I also gained more hands-on experience with Flexbox and CSS Grid, and while there's still much to learn, I'm excited for future challenges.

One specific challenge was aligning the `user-info` div. Initially, I thought using Flexbox or Grid for such a small area might be overkill since I assumed these tools were best suited for larger layouts. This project taught me, however, that Flexbox and Grid are incredibly versatile; they’re just as useful for handling intricate details as they are for structuring entire layouts.  

While I once hesitated to use these tools on smaller sections, I've come to see that Flexbox and Grid are not only powerful but also "humble." They adapt seamlessly to any task, big or small, and can be trusted to handle everything with precision. Moving forward, I’ll try to stop being overly cautious and embrace their full potential, appreciating that they make alignment and structure simpler, regardless of the area’s size.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 1rem;
  min-height:100vh;
}
```
